# Mining-in-the-legal-Amazon
In this project, I study the evolution of mine sizes in the Legal Amazon and create descriptive visualizations using Stata. 

In order to execute the code, the users has to download the shapefile (map of Brazil) at IBGE.gov at the Municipality level (Municipios). 

The PDF contains the graphical representations made with Stata
